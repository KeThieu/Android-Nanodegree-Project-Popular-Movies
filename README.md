# Android-Nanodegree-Project-Popular-Movies
This repository contains Project 1 and 2 of Udacity's Nanodegree Curriculum. We fetch data from The Movie Database using their API, and sort them into a Grid based on Popularity and or User Rating. -Work-in-Progress-

My API Key is hidden within my local gradle module; it shouldn't be within the project itself. I accessed it via Build.Config in my Grid_Fragment class.
When you grade, feel free to replace the following line with your API Key
